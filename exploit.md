# Exploit Title: Unauthenticated Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in PHPGurukul Nipah virus (NiV) – Testing Management System
# Date: 20-11-2023
# Exploit Author: dhabaleshwardas
# Vendor Homepage: https://phpgurukul.com/
# Software Link: https://phpgurukul.com/nipah-virus-niv-testing-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/
# Version: 1.0
# Tested on: firefox/chrome/brave
# CVE : 
```


To reproduce the attack:

1- Head to the http://localhost/nipah-tms/patient-search-report.php endpoint 

2- Here you would be asked to give a value in the "Search By Patient Name or Mobile Number or Order Number" parameter. Simply input a XSS payload:  <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

3- As soon as you hit "Search" the payload would be triggered and "Cookie" would be displayed in a pop-up.

4- In the code snippet below, the vulnerability is introduced in the following line:

```
<h1 class="h3 mb-2 text-gray-800">Search Result Against '<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'</h1>
```
Here, user input is directly embedded into the HTML content without proper sanitization or encoding. The string '**<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>**' is rendered as part of the HTML, making it vulnerable to script injection.

5- Although Reflected XSS is not as critical as Stored XSS but still it can be used to steal user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim and perform actions on their behalf and can even redirect users to malicious websites. 

**Remediation:** 

1- Validate and sanitize user input on the server side. Ensure that input adheres to expected patterns and formats.

2- Encode user input before displaying it in the HTML output. HTML-encode special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
